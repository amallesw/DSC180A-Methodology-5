## Assignment Responses

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we covered was finding effective ways to format complex data relating to mental health. This data can come in complex forms, ranging from video to neurophysiological data. Therefore, models that deal with multimodal representations of data are important to optimize.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One investigation I'd like to make is to use mulitask learning when developing ML models. By leverage unlabeled data during training for self-supervised learning, we can potentially expose our model to more real world data to learn from.
