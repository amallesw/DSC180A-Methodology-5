## Assignment Responses

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we covered was finding effective ways to format complex data relating to mental health. This data can come in complex forms, ranging from video to neurophysiological data. Therefore, models that deal with multimodal representations of data are important to optimize.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One investigation I'd like to make is to use mulitask learning when developing ML models. By leverage unlabeled data during training for self-supervised learning, we can potentially expose our model to more real world data to learn from.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I'd like to make in our current approach is to focus on one specific area of mental health. Right now we are aiming to tackle mental health in early human life, but since this is such a broad topic, we may be able to build more effective models in a specifc area. Specifically, I'd like to either focus on the cognitive or behavioral aspects of mental health.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
There are various novel feature engineering and feature selection methods that were discussed in different scientific papers we have read. There methods dealt specifically with high dimensional and multimodel data.
